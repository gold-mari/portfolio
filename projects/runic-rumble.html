        <h1>Runic Rumble [PROTOTYPE]</h1>
        <a href="/index.html">Back to projects!</a>
        <hr>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Runic Rumble</strong> is a realtime card-based battler that me and a group of 8 other developers worked
            on as a part of UC Santa Cruz's games major capstone. I assisted as an external collaborator, and served as a
            tools programmer and a systems designer in Unity, using C#.
        </p>

        <p><strong>This is a prototype portfolio section. Things will not be described in full detail, and most images
            will be omitted, but I'd prefer to have something rather than nothing!
        </strong></p>

        <h2>Contribution Highlights</h2>

        <h3 id="card">Card Authoring Tools</h3>
        <p>In Runic Rumble, the player attacks and interacts with enemies through the use of a diverse set of cards with 
            different combinations of effects. Card effects span dealing damage, applying status effects, instantiating
            game objects, and more. I was responsible for the initial development of the card and card effect system,
            developed many of the core effects, and supported other programmers in developing further effects.
            
            My priorities for this system were:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Card effects should be able to do anything. Cards should be able to have any
                    number of effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Designer-friendliness:</strong> New cards should be simple to create and edit for non-programmers. 
                    The creation of new card effects should be made as easy as possible for non-programmers.</li>
            </ul>

            Using the Scriptable Object system in Unity, I developed a base Card class which card assets would be created from.
        </p>

        <h3 id="entity">Entity Trait Framework</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of the quarter, I designed a component system that would allow all entities in the game- from the 
            player, to enemies, to stage hazards- to be built from the same framework. An entity in Runic Rumble is defined as
            a game object possessing some combination of traits, including:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damageable</strong>: This entity has health, can be damaged, and can die.</li>
                <li><strong>Targetable</strong>: This entity has a "team" affiliation (Player-team vs Enemy-team), and can be directly targeted
                    by a card.</li>
                <li><strong>Effectable</strong>: This entity can have status effects applied to them.</li>
            </ul>
            Each separate trait was implemented as a separate C# script, and each entity was implemented as a Unity GameObject.
            In order to add traits to an entity, a designer would just need to add components to the GameObject, a very simple
            Unity operation.
        </p>

        <p>
            This system was iterated on over the course of the 3 months of development: components were added due to new
            functionality elsewhere, and dropped due to a lack of use cases. The flexibility of this system allowed for these
            course-corrections to be simple and painless, since there were no hard-coded dependencies.
